# asmy.dev

my website at [asmy.dev](https://asmy.dev) powered by [11ty](https://11ty.dev), [bulma](https://bulma.io) and [openemoji](https://openemoji.org). The idea stems from "I just wanna get my personal website up and running quickly because I don't have time for this since I got a full time job" ideology. This is where I keep the source code in case I need to do some editing in the future or to showcase how did I do it.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- a working laptop
- stable internet connection
- npm installed

### Setup

Simply run this to install 11ty framework in the directory where this repo is unziped or cloned to 
```
npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev

run through all of the setup and then finally
